Expanded documentation for the `readme-md-cli` project.

Project Package Interpretation
------------------------------
When the `readme-md` CLI command is executed in a project directory's root it
attempts to extract and interpret as much information from the `package.json`
file as possible if one exists.

The documents generated by this utility consist of various sections consisting
of both a title and a body. The following sections are generated based upon the
gathered package data:

### Title Section
This section consists of a level one header which acts as the document title and
a brief project description in the body. The title is populated with the value
of the package's `name` property while the body is populated with the value of
the package's `description` property.

Given the following package:

```json
{
  "name": "package-name",
  "description": "A brief description."
}
```

The following section markup will be output:

```md
package-name
------------
A brief description.
```

### Install Section
This section consists of a level two header titled "Install" and a body
containing a fenced code block with the package install command derived from
the package's `name` property.

Given the following package:

```json
{
  "name": "package-name"
}
```

The following section markup will be output:

````md
Install
-------
```sh
$ npm install --save package-name
```
````

However, if a `yarn.lock` file is present in the root of the project directory
the following variant markup will be output:

````md
Install
-------
```sh
$ yarn add package-name # Or alternatively: `npm install --save package-name`
```
````

Global install instructions will be output in the event of
[preferGlobal](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#preferglobal) being
defined as `true` in the project's `package.json`.

Given the following package:

```json
{
  "name": "package-name",
  "preferGlobal": true
}
```

The following section markup will be output:

````md
Install
-------
```sh
$ npm install --global package-name
```
````

However, if a `yarn.lock` file is present in the root of the project directory
the following variant markup will be output:

````md
Install
-------
```sh
$ yarn global add package-name # Or alternatively: `npm install --global package-name`
```
````

### Usage Section
A usage section can be drafted and stored in a
`.config/readme-md/sections/usage.md` file relative to your project root. Given
that `$PROJECT` represents the path to a project then an absolute path
representation would be `$PROJECT/.config/readme-md/sections/usage.md`.

The contents of this Markdown document will be trimed and posted directly below
a "Usage" header following the "Install" section.

### Testing Section
This section consists of a level two header titled "Testing" and a body
containing a fenced code block with the package testing command if the package's
`scripts.test` property is defined and a non-empty string.

Given the following package:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cli-test-bin"
  }
}
```

The following section markup will be output:

````md
Testing
-------
```sh
$ npm test
```
````

### License Section
This section consists of a level two header titled "License" and a body
containing a declaration of the package's license status.

Given the following package:

```json
{
  "license": "EXAMPLE"
}
```

The following section markup will be output:

```md
License
-------
The EXAMPLE License. See the license file for details.
```

In addition, if a `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, or `LICENSE.txt` file is present in
the root of the project directory the license will be hyperlinked.

Given that a `LICENSE` file is present in our project root the following variant
markup will be output:

```md
License
-------
The EXAMPLE License. See the [license](LICENSE) file for details.
```

Project Level Configuration
---------------------------
Project specific configuration is stored in `.config/readme-md/config.yml` file
relative to your project root. Given that `$PROJECT` represents the path to a
project then an absolute path representation would be
`$PROJECT/.config/readme-md/config.yml`.

Parameters are defined via the following properties:

### `see-also`
Enables and defines the contents of a "See Also" section positioned at the `-1`
section index. An object consisting of `<link text>: <target uri>` key/value
pairs e.g. _(`Example: http://www.example.org/`)_.

Given the following config:

```yml
see-also:
  Example: http://www.example.org/
  IETF: https://www.ietf.org/
```

The following section markup will be output:

```md
See Also
--------
- [Example](http://www.example.org/)
- [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)
```
