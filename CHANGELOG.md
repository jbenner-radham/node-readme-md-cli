and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

[Unreleased]
------------
### Added
- The "shortcut syntax" for the `repository` property in `package.json` is now supported. See [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#repository) for reference.

[0.15.0] - 2024-10-06
---------------------
### Added
- Documented the `description` config option in `doc/README.md`.
- Detection of [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
- A `prefer-npm` config option, which can have a Boolean value. Setting this to `true` will cause the examples in the "Install" and "Testing" sections to always use npm. Defaults to `false`.
- A `prefer-semicolons` config option, which can have a Boolean value. This parameter decides whether statements in the autogenerated "Usage" section should be terminated by a semicolon. Defaults to `true`.
- A `quote-type` config option, which can have a value of either "double" or "single". This parameter decides what quote type to use in the autogenerated "Usage" section. Defaults to "single".

### Changed
- Upgraded `meow` and `readme-md` dependencies.
- Updated the generated alt text for badge images to be more descriptive.
- If no `.config/readme-md/sections/usage.md` file is present a basic "Usage" section will now be autogenerated.

### Security
- Addressed three vulnerabilities in dependencies of dependencies by rebuilding the lockfile.

[0.14.0] - 2024-10-04
---------------------
### Changed
- Updated "Usage" section of `README.md`.
- Configuration (_e.g._, `.config/readme-md/config.yaml`) variables are now normalized as [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) internally which means config variables can be in the form of camelCase, kebab-case, snake_case, etc.
- Upgraded `yarn-lockfile-exists` dependency which improves filepath logic for Windows environments.
- The required Node.js version is now ^18.19.0 || >=20.5.0.

- The minimum required [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is now v16.
- Generated fenced code blocks for shell script (_e.g._, the Install and Testing sections) no longer have a dollar sign prefix.
- For packages which are MIT licensed the value "(Expat)" is no longer suffixed in the generated License section.
- Passing no license or an empty license will now output "_To be documented._" in the body of the License section.
- Project config now supports and prioritizes `.config/readme-md/config.yaml` files. The search order goes like so: `config.yaml` then `config.yml`.
